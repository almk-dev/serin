## changes
This layout is a more balanced version of [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/).

I wanted to accomplish the following:
- Improve Colemak-DH's LSB metric without sacrificing too much in other areas

## comparisons
##### colemak-dh
##### canary

## mods
- The `J`/`Z` keys can be swapped with nearly zero impact to stats, if the `Z` shortcut is prefered on the left-hand side
- The `E`/`A` keys can be swapped to optimize for SteveP's [analyzer](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/analyze.html), yielding a **_matrix effort score of 1.717_**
  - However, this results in a less balanced workload across the fingers, and performs worse on other analyzers
